# Interesting-Class-Labs
Labs that I've done in class and enjoyed.

All of these labs have been uploaded AFTER the end of the due date; therefore no cheating of any kind can occur.
The posting of my solutions to these labs are so that others can see my thought process when problem solving and offer alternate ways to solve them.
Otherwise, I just I just found the labs fun and wanted to share.
